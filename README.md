## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- localStorage - for keeping bookmarked movies or TV series
- React useContext
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) - React Icons
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - for sign up and log in
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) - For input form

### What I learned

During this challenge first time, I was working with Firebase and Chakra UI.
When I was building the project I got knowledge of how to use Chakra UI.

I had a problem with importing provided SVG icons with Chakra UI and because of that, I used icons from react-icons.

### Useful resources

- [Code a Reddit Clone with React, Next.js, Firebase v9, Chakra UI â€“ Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCm5RVYKWVg&t=28649s) - This course helped me with Chakra UI but mostly with how to implement Firebase to this project.

## Acknowledgments

As I mentioned before I want to thank you for the Reddit clone course. It was much helpful when I was working on this project. It showed step-by-step how to start working with firebase and how to use it.
